## NHS Drivetime Calculator

## About
This app is an internal tool created by a small team of 5 University students for the infomatics team at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board (BCUHB). It is an easy to use web-based tool which is designed to determine the commute time between two or more known points and export the travel into an SQL database along with any other useful metadata. The Google Maps API platform is used for maps, routing and traffic data.

The project is currently on schedule to be completed in **May 2019.**
