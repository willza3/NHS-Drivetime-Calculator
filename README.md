# Teithio

## About
**Teithio** is an internal tool created by a small team of 5 University students for the infomatics team at Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board (BCUHB). It is an easy to use web-based tool which is designed to determine the commute time between two or more known points and export the travel into an SQL database along with any other useful metadata. It currently uses the HERE API for maps, routing, traffic and weather data. Teithio does not currently have a license, however one will be considered soon.

The project is currently on schedule to be completed in **May 2019.**
